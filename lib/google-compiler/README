The Closure Compiler performs checking, instrumentation, and
optimizations on JavaScript code. The purpose of this README is to
explain how to build and run the Closure Compiler.

The Closure Compiler requires Java 6 or higher.
http://www.java.com/


//
// Building The Closure Compiler
//

There are three ways to get a Closure Compiler executable.

1) Use one we built for you.

Pre-built Closure binaries can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/downloads/list


2) Check out the source and build it with Apache Ant.

First, check out the full source tree of the Closure Compiler. There
are instructions on how to do this at the project site.
http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/source/checkout

Apache Ant is a cross-platform build tool.
http://ant.apache.org/

At the root of the source tree, there is an Ant file named
build.xml. To use it, navigate to the same directory and type the
command

ant jar

This will produce a jar file called "build/compiler.jar".


3) Check out the source and build it with Eclipse.

Eclipse is a cross-platform IDE.
http://www.eclipse.org/

Under Eclipse's File menu, click "New > Project ..." and create a
"Java Project."  You will see an options screen. Give the project a
name, select "Create project from existing source," and choose the
root of the checked-out source tree as the existing directory. Verify
that you are using JRE version 6 or higher.

Eclipse can use the build.xml file to discover rules. When you
navigate to the build.xml file, you will see all the build rules in
the "Outline" pane. Run the "jar" rule to build the compiler in
build/compiler.jar.


//
// Running The Closure Compiler
//

Once you have the jar binary, running the Closure Compiler is straightforward.

On the command line, type

java -jar compiler.jar

This starts the compiler in interactive mode. Type

var x = 17 + 25;

then hit "Enter", then hit "Ctrl-Z" (on Windows) or "Ctrl-D" (on Mac or Linux)
and "Enter" again. The Compiler will respond:

var x=42;

The Closure Compiler has many options for reading input from a file,
writing output to a file, checking your code, and running
optimizations. To learn more, type

java -jar compiler.jar --help

You can read more detailed documentation about the many flags at
http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_app.html


//
// Compiling Multiple Scripts
//

If you have multiple scripts, you should compile them all together with
one compile command.

java -jar compiler.jar --js=in1.js --js=in2.js ... --js_output_file=out.js

The Closure Compiler will concatenate the files in the order they're
passed at the command line.

If you need to compile many, many scripts together, you may start to
run into problems with managing dependencies between scripts. You
should check out the Closure Library. It contains functions for
enforcing dependencies between scripts, and a tool called calcdeps.py
that knows how to give scripts to the Closure Compiler in the right
order.
